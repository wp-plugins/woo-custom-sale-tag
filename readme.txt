Customize the sale tag that appears on WooCommerce product thumbnails when a product sale price is set lower than the retail price.

== Description ==

When a WooCommerce product is on sale, a tag is placed on top of the Product Thumbnails. The default label for this tag is "Sale!". 
This plugin allows you to customize the label and can even insert the price difference or percent difference. Examples:

* Save 20%
* 20% off!
* Save $5.00
* $5.00 off!

== Installation ==

* Install this just like any other Wordpress plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I style my Sale Tag? =

This plugin only modifies the sale tag label/text. Your theme's CSS specifies the appearance of the sale tag.

= How do I translate the labels? =

This currently isn't built-in. But all text in the plugin is ready for translation - just use another 3rd party plugin to do this for you.
